/**
************* Interfaces extending classes ********************

TypeScript allows an interface to extend a class. In this case, the interface inherits the properties and methods of the class.
Also, the interface can inherit the private and protected members of the class, not just the public members.

It means that when an interface extends a class with private or protected members, the interface can only be implemented by that class or subclasses of that class from which the interface extends.

By doing this, you restrict the usage of the interface to only class or subclasses of the class from which the interface extends.
If you attempt to implement the interface from a class that is not a subclass of the class that the interface inherited, youâ€™ll get an error. For example:
 */
class Control {
    state;
    constructor(state) {
        this.state = state;
    }
}
class Button extends Control {
    enable() { }
}
class TextBox extends Control {
    enable() { }
}
class Label extends Control {
}
// Error: cannot implement
// class Chart implements StatefulControl {
//   enable() {}
// }
/**
An interface can extend one or multiple existing interfaces.

An interface also can extend a class. If the class contains private or protected members,
the interface can only be implemented by the class or subclasses of that class.

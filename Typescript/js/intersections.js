Introduction to TypeScript intersection types
An intersection type creates a new type by combining multiple existing types. The new type has all features of the existing types.

To combine types, you use the & operator as follows:

type typeAB = typeA & typeB;
The typeAB will have all properties from both typeA and typeB.

Note that the union type uses the | operator that defines a variable which can hold a value of either typeA or typeB
let varName = typeA | typeB; // union type

/**
Type Order
When you intersect types, the order of the types doesnâ€™t matter. For example:

type typeAB = typeA & typeB;
type typeBA = typeB & typeA;







An intersection type combines two or more types to create a new type that has all properties of the existing types.
The type order is not important when you combine types.
